# molparser
A Python script for parsing chemical mol and sdf files into a javascript format for use with the [concept-formation](https://github.com/cmaclell/concept_formation) python library.

The script will parse a $$$$ delimited sdf file and return a list of python dictionary describing each molecule in the sdf file. The implementation is loosely based on [this](http://c4.cabrillo.edu/404/ctfile.pdf) description of the sdf file format. The intention in this implementation is to turn a base file format into one that is more ammenable to the Treslte algorithm in the [concept-formation](https://github.com/cmaclell/concept_formation) python library. There is quite a lot of information in an sdf file and it is completely possible that the process throws out important chemical information. The main intention is to capture common structural information and so the focus is mainly on the atom and bond blocks of a mol representation. Extra information can be included with a paramter flag but it is mostly just appended to the dictionary without much thought or processing.

The main method of validation is to run the parser against any of the files listed on the [pubchem database](ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubchem/Compound/CURRENT-Full/SDF/) to verify that no errors are thrown in the process. No effort is made to verify the content beyond that.
